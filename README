This filter started with a need for an etching of Lewis
Carroll for a talk I gave at the Open Source Bridge
Conference 2011. It turns out I couldn't easily find one, so
I looked for a GIMP plugin to process a photo into a
synthetic etching. After some digging around, the most
promising thing I could find was a Perl plug-in posted by
Sam Jones in 2001 to an email list.

I've taken Jones's plugin as an inspiration, and written a
Scheme Script-Fu plugin with similar operation.  My plugin
produces marginal-quality synthetic etchings.

The code currently leaves several layers lying around when
it is done; you can adjust each layer as you like and then
merge them manually if desired. The layers are a
"penciled-in" layer, with NW and NE crosshatch layers above
that.

Planned future enhancements include more control, some
additional modes, and optional automatic layer merging.

I have placed my code under GPLv2 to clarify GIMP license
compatibility. Please see the file COPYING in this
distribution for license details. I do not believe that my
current code is a derivative work of Sam Jones's code per US
copyright law. I have attempted to contact Sam Jones without
success. Hopefully, he will appear at some point and give
the project his blessing.
